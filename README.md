# AudioProcessing-MFCC-DTW
This is a JavaFX desktop application for computing MFCCs (Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients) of input words, and finding the most similar sounding words from the database using DTW (dynamic time warp).

## Overview
The application supports .wav files as input, the user can also record sounds within the application. After the MFCCs of the input audio are computed, the results can be stored in the database or just be used for analysis - finding the most similar sounding words from the database using DTW. Saved audio files can be played, renamed and deleted within the application. During audio playback the application also provides a spectrum visualizer.
